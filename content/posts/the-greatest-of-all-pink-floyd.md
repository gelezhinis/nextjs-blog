Pink FLoyd is a **GOAT**.

Pink Floyd were founded in 1965 by Syd Barrett (guitar, lead vocals), Nick Mason (drums), Roger Waters (bass guitar, vocals), Richard Wright (keyboards, vocals). The band had previously undergone previous incarnations and names before officially operating under the name Pink Floyd. Under Barrett's leadership, they released two charting singles and the successful debut album The Piper at the Gates of Dawn (1967). 

## Pink Floyd's works

Following personal tensions, Wright left Pink Floyd in 1979, followed by Waters in 1985. Gilmour and Mason continued as Pink Floyd, rejoined later by Wright. They produced two more albums—A Momentary Lapse of Reason (1987) and The Division Bell (1994)—and toured in support of both albums before entering a long period of inactivity. In 2005, all but Barrett reunited for a one-off performance at the global awareness event Live 8.
